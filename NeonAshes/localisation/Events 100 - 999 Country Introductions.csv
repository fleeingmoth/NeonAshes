EVT_101_NAME;The Republic of British Columbia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_101_DESC;After the Second World War, the Conservative-Liberal Coalition that had ruled over British Columbia had collapsed, and the political vacuum that it left behind was filled by the British Columbia Social Credit Party, led by William Andrew Cecil "W. A. C." Bennett, who held the reins of power in the province for the next thirty years.\n\nThe economic growth and prosperity was particularly felt in Western Canada, especially with the discovery and exploitation of natural resources in the Prairie provinces and the Pacific coast of Canada and the United States. And while the Liberals in Eastern Canada and the right-wing Social Credit Party in Victoria did not see eye to eye in many affairs, they kept an unofficial policy of cooperation and pragmatism.\n\nThis "detente" lasted well until the 70s, and until the death in office of W.A.C. Bennett...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_102_NAME;The Independent Republic of the Canadian Prairies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_102_DESC;The relationship between the Prairie provinces - Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba - and the government in Ottawa has shifted between begrudging acceptance and open hostility throughout the years. Far from the centers of power and major ports in Canada, the prairie nations developed their own independent culture and a sense of rebelliousness.\n\nThis so-called "Western Alienation" was tampered down by the economic success and redistribution of wealth across the provinces in the post-war era, but with the deteriorating situation in Ontario and Quebec, and the increasing centralization of the rent of the land in Ottawa, the provinces rebelled.\n\nAfter years of political protests, the Resource Wars of 1971 brought the economic flow between Eastern and Western canada to a standstill and were, alongside the Quebecois independence movements, the catalysts to reform the Canadian political and governance structure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_103_NAME;The Union of the Canadian Maritimes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_103_DESC;Located between New England, Quebec and Newfoundland, the Union of the Canadian Maritimes is the final result of a decades-long unification process between the former Canadian provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island.\n\nAlthough its declining industry was slowly overshadowed by the bigger provinces and cities in the south and west, the Maritimes reaped the benefits of Canadian political and economic stability in the post-war period, acting as the Canadian gateway to the Atlantic.\n\nThe increase in trade, shift towards a service economy, and financial transfers between the wealthier provinces and the Maritimes made them a small yet prosperous region in eastern Canada, satisfied with their place in the nation.\n\nHowever, events in Quebec and Ottawa would quickly shatter this idyllic situation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_104_NAME;The Republic of Newfoundland;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_104_DESC;The victory of Anti-Federalists in the 1948 referendums ensured that Newfoundland remained as an independent Dominion of the United Kingdom and, ultimately, set them on a path towards full autonomy.\n\nAs the British and European economies stagnated in the 1950s, the Canadian and American economies surged and, although not keen in outright incorporation into either, the Newfoundlanders sought closer ties with them and became a key ally in the North Atlantic. After the 1950s wave of decolonization and the 1963 Devolution Act, these ties served as the conduit for the government in St. John's to call for immediate patriation for Newfoundland.\n\nAt first, Newfoundlanders supported union with Canada, but by the 1968 referendum, the political deterioration in both Canada and the United States led to a narrow Autonomist victory, and the creation of an independent Newfoundland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_105_NAME;The Northwest Territories Autonomous Region;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_105_DESC;Collectively known as "The North", the territories of the Yukon and the Northwest Territories have never enjoyed independence, or even autonomy, within the last century. The emerging Cold War made the Arctic an ideological boundary, and the growing need for resources and trade pushed several Americans, Canadians, and Indigenous peoples to settle the far north.\n\nFor a while, Ottawa managed to quell dissent in the Arctic thanks to political dominance of the Liberals, national stability, and economic prosperity that allowed to funnel resources into the Territories to keep them in line. However, as opposition to Ottawa grew in Quebec and in the West, the people of the North saw their chance.\n\nAs the economy of the Western provinces surged, they claimed that the Northwest Territories and Yukon ought to be ruled from the West or, at the very least, not under the absolute control of Ottawa. Given the low population and economic development of the territories, it was unrealistic to demand full independence, but greater autonomy was certainly attainable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_106_NAME;The Ontario Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_106_DESC;After the Second World War, the government in Ottawa, and its predominantly Liberal government, reaped the benefits. The expansion of the social safety net and equalization payments between the provinces in the 1950s helped cement the Liberals dominant position in the country and fostered social and political stability, in stark contrast to its southern neighbors at the time.\n\nAs with many things, however, this was too good to last. The ingrained political power of the Liberals over several decades, fueled by domestic stability and a resurgence of liberalism in Quebec, led to complacency, political apathy, and increasingly brazen behavior by the Liberals.\n\nThe electoral collapse of the Social Credit Party and the conservative factions rallying around the Progressive Conservative Party in the early 60s were the first signs of trouble, although the convergence of resource disputes, Quebecois nationalism, and First Nations dissent what caused the Liberal (and ultimately Ottawan) dominion over Canada...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_107_NAME;The Republic of Quebec;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_107_DESC;The post-war period saw Canada embarking in a period of peace, prosperity, and neutrality, away from the turbulent conflicts in Asia and Europe, and Quebec was no exception.\n\nA relatively stable economy and a national focus against communism led to Maurice Duplessis, and his right-wing nationalist National Union Party, to hold onto power until his death in office in 1959 (and the death of his successor shortly thereafter). However, growing dissent against traditionalism led to a Liberal victory in 1960, and a quiet revolution towards secularization, a strong welfare state, and political realignment between federalists separatist factions in Quebec.\n\nAs Quebecois developed their own national identity, however, there were louder calls for increased autonomy, with some calling for an outright secession from Canada. Coupled with growing nationalism in western Canada, things were quickly reaching their boiling point by 1970...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_108_NAME;The Alaskan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVT_108_DESC;Ironically, the last State to join the Union was the first State that attempted secession.\n\nAfter World War II, Alaska became a key location for the United States to surveil and counter the Soviet Union, and to project power in the Northern Pacific and Arctic oceans. And as the territory became militarized, new mineral riches were discovered under its land: mining for oil, metals and rare materials became a brief, although enthusiastic, new gold rush. Empowered by these new riches, and clamoring for equal representation in Washington, Alaskans voted for statehood in 1959.\n\nAt the same time, the federal government was tightening its grip over Alaska's resources, seeking to federalize them. The wars in Europe and Asia were taking their toll in the economy, and raw materials were desperately needed for the war effort. Alaskans refused, but Washington saw the perfect opportunity to press the issue just a few years later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_180_DESC;The winds of independence had been blowing over the Western provinces of Canada for the better part of a century. And when they struck, they disintegrated into three major countries: British Columbia, the Canadian Prairies, and the Northwestern Territories.\n\nAfter several decades of strife and bickering, however, we became the dominant country in the region, and managed to wrest control over the Pacific coast and the interior plains. This prompted $CAPITAL$ to declare the creation of a new Western Canadian state to consolidate the regional goals under one banner, and to stand up to possible geostrategic risks from the south and the east, not to mention to consolidate their control over the region.\n\nAs of today, a new flag rises in Western Canada...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_182_DESC;Canada, as a state, ceased its existence in 1978, but the Canadian nation endured.\n\nAutonomous republics, loosely tied under the Canadian Compact, sought to carve their own path across the continent. Although regional capitals cheered, some were convinced that the ties that bind us are stronger than the differences, and that the reunification of Canada was, if not inevitable, at least likely.\n\nAnd they were right.\n\nToday, in $YEAR$, a new flag of Canada rises once more, hoisted from Vancouver to Quebec, from Ottawa to the Arctic. We will face the challenges of decades ago, of our forefathers, certainly with more knowledge, hopefully with more wisdom, than in their time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVT_601_DESC;The British colonies of East Africa, long benefiting from a shared market, decided to become independant together as a federated union in 1964. While the british empire crumbled in europe, the federation had only a few years of exisistance until a crisis erupted within Uganda between the Buganda Kingdom desiring a equal place under the EAF and the new president of Uganada, Idi Amin. This Crisis quickly escalated into the first EAF-Uganda war by 1970 as the federal government under Julius Nyerere, attempted to oust the dictatorial Amin. This war was set to be over quickly, however the Resource Wars had by then restarted in europe, causing the global market of modern arms that the EAF armed forces relied on to be quickly depleted. By the mid 1970s the war had drawn out into a stalemate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
